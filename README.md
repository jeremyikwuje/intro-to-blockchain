### About the author,

I'm Jeremy, a Nigerian-born blockchain [engineer](https://twitter.com/jeremyikwuje) and Bitcoin "priest".  I got into Bitcoin in 2017, as a way to make money, little did I know that Bitcoin is beyond a just financial asset. It is a breakthrough in technology and the beginning of a new world.

My goal is to contribute to the spread of blockchain and Bitcoin knowledge worldwide.

### Blockchain > Bitcoin

Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a blockchain and not the only blockchain, there are other blockchains today like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot.

But there's no way we can effectively introduce blockchain without mentioning Bitcoin - the significant beginning of it all. Learning about Bitcoin is foundational in learning about blockchain.

So we are going to start by learning about Bitcoin and the problem it solves.
