# What is a Blockchain?

Blockchain is an open, decentralized and immutable database. A database is just data held in a computer.

The blockchain database is open, meaning anyone can access, read, and store information in it at any time. The database is decentralized, meaning that it stores information across a distributed computer network, instead of a single device. This database is also immutable, meaning that data written on the network can't be changed.

In a blockchain, data are stored in blocks. It is literally a chain of blocks. Think of it as blocks of data lined together piece by piece and each block is unique and a continuation of the previous.

At this point, this may not be easy for you to grasp. But just know that a blockchain allows anyone to do **trustless transactions** that are ***open, decentralized, and unchangeable***. Trustless, means that we trust code and computer networks rather than trusting a middleman or single entity like a bank or Paypal.

**Each blockchain has a consensus mechanism**, a way in which the network agrees on what new information is stored on that database.
